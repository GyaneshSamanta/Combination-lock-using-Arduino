## Problem Statement ðŸš§

Create and Implement smart door lock systems. 

## Background ðŸ“–

With the advent of smart home technology, living has never been easier. Aided by an ever growing community of smart appliances, people can now control devices inside their home from anywhere in the world. Whether it be lights, refrigerators, fans or even their Electric vehicles. 

Arduino Uno (and other microcontrollers) help to smart-ify simple electrical/electronics components into smart appliances. Sometimes, trivial appliances as doors or window shutters can also be automated with the help of these microcontrollers. 

In this project, we try to implement a password combination door lock using Arduino Uno.
