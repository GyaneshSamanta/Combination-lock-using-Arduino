# Combination-lock-using-Arduino

# Project Description
In the 5th Semester at SRMIST, we had to make a miniproject on `Embedded systems design using Arduino`using Tinkercad.

## Problem Statement ðŸš§

Create and Implement smart door lock systems. 

## Background ðŸ“–

With the advent of smart home technology, living has never been easier. Aided by an ever growing community of smart appliances, people can now control devices inside their home from anywhere in the world. Whether it be lights, refrigerators, fans or even their Electric vehicles. 

Arduino Uno (and other microcontrollers) help to smart-ify simple electrical/electronics components into smart appliances. Sometimes, trivial appliances as doors or window shutters can also be automated with the help of these microcontrollers. 

In this project, we try to implement a password combination door lock using Arduino Uno. 

## Working ðŸ”¨

The project will help us to set combination password and you can set password by using 1-6 digits, When you will push the buttons, and the combination is matched the green LED will be turned on and if the combination is not matched the Red LED will indicate that the password is wrong.

## Interfacing of Push Buttons

The push buttons can be interfaced by arduino using pull down configuration i.e. button will give 5V when pressed and 0V when released and pull up configuration i.e. when button is pressed it will give 0V and when released it will give 5V. We are using pull up configuration and we are not using any external resistor instead we are using arduino internal pull up resistor.
